# Conway Game Practice

Make sure to install OpenCV before compiling.

The initial state is random.

The first command-line argument represents the duration of a cycle in milliseconds in the visualization module.

The second command-line argument represents which snapshot of the life cycle the user wants to capture. The value range is between 1 and 150.

The third command-line argument is "broad size," which has a value range of 1 to 2048.

```
make
./gameoflife [wait_time] [snap_shot_frame] [board_size]
```
